/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Driving the real page in a real browser.

   The player is one file of DOM code with no module boundary, so there
   is nothing to import and assert against. What can be done is to run
   it the way it actually runs and then measure the result, which is
   also the only way to catch what the suite is for here: layout that
   collapses, icons that come out the wrong size, menus that paint over
   each other. None of that is visible to a unit test.

   The trick is that the page under test is the real index.html with one
   script appended. It is copied to a temporary directory together with
   the styles, the code and the fonts, so the files being tested are
   byte for byte the ones that ship, and nothing in the project is
   modified to make testing possible.

   Chrome writes the page out and then lingers, so we wait for the dump
   and stop it ourselves rather than waiting for it to exit.
